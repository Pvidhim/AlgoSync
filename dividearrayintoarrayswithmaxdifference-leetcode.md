# Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference - LeetCode
  
  ## Problem Description
  
  Can you solve this real interview question? Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference - You are given an integer array nums of size n where n is a multiple of 3 and a positive integer k.

Divide the array nums into n / 3 arrays of size 3 satisfying the following condition:

 * The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.

Return a 2D array containing the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.
  
  ### Examples:
  ```
  Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2

Output: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]

Explanation:

The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,4,2,2,5,2], k = 2

Output: []

Explanation:

Different ways to divide nums into 2 arrays of size 3 are:

 * [[2,2,2],[2,4,5]] (and its permutations)
 * [[2,2,4],[2,2,5]] (and its permutations)

Because there are four 2s there will be an array with the elements 2 and 5 no matter how we divide it. since 5 - 2 = 3 > k, the condition is not satisfied and so there is no valid division.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,2,9,8,2,12,7,12,10,5,8,5,5,7,9,2,5,11], k = 14

Output: [[2,2,12],[4,8,5],[5,9,7],[7,8,5],[5,9,10],[11,12,2]]

Explanation:

The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 14.
  ```
  
  ### Constraints:
  
  Constraints:

 * n == nums.length
 * 1 <= n <= 105
 * n is a multiple of 3
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 105
 * 1 <= k <= 105

            for(int j = 0 ; j < 3 ; j++){
                answer[i][j] = nums[a];
                a++;
            }
        }
        for(int l = 0 ; l < n/3 ; l++){
            if((answer[l][1] - answer[l][0] > k) || (answer[l][2]-answer[l][1] > k) || (answer[l][2] - answer[l][0] > k) ){
                flag = 1;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(flag == 1){
            answer.clear();
        }
        return answer ;
        
    }
};
